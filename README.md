# Llama Goggles

Shared styles for Lessonly Apps (Lessonly integrations).

To visit the showroom, go to https://about.lessonly.engineering/llama_goggles/

Llama Goggles uses the BEM CSS conventions: http://getbem.com/

# How To Use

Simply copy the `llama_goggles.css` into your project and go! You can build on just these styles, or maybe you just use them as a starting point and customize them for your needs.

# What Does Yonder Pasture Hold

In the future, we want to keep adding components that we create for an integration back to Llama Goggles.

We would like to maybe set up scss preprocessing so that we can write scss and output a css file.

Perhaps a minified file would be nice too.

It might even be nice to version it in releases (maybe using tagged releases in github).

We could even host a versions of it behind a CDN if we didn't want to copy and paste someday.
